# 🚀 Sharp Recruit Launch Playbook
## Week 1-2 Marketing Battle Plan

---

## 📅 LinkedIn Content Calendar (14 Days)

### Day 1 (Monday) - The Hook
**Post Type:** Story/Announcement
```
I built an AI recruiting app on Christmas Day.

Here's what I learned about shipping fast:

1. Perfectionism is the enemy
2. Streamlit > building from scratch
3. Users don't care about your tech stack
4. They care about their problems

The app screens 50 CVs in 10 minutes.
It's live. It's free to try.

Sometimes you just gotta ship.

What's something you've been putting off launching?

#buildinpublic #recruiting #ai
```

### Day 2 (Tuesday) - Pain Point
**Post Type:** Hot take
```
Recruiters spend 23 hours per week on admin tasks.

That's 1,196 hours per year.

Reviewing CVs. Writing JDs. Prepping interviews.

Tasks that AI can do in minutes.

The best recruiters I know aren't drowning in spreadsheets.

They're building relationships.

Admin work should be automated.
Human work should stay human.

```

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - Value Post
**Post Type:** Tips/Education
```
How to write a job description that actually attracts talent:

1. Lead with impact, not requirements
   → "You'll build the future of X" beats "Must have 5 years experience"

2. Be specific about compensation
   → Salary ranges get 30% more applicants

3. Show, don't tell culture
   → "We ship weekly" beats "fast-paced environment"

4. Keep it scannable
   → Bullets > paragraphs
   → 500-800 words max

5. End with a clear CTA
   → "Apply here" with one link

I built an AI that writes JDs in 2 minutes.

### Day 4 (Thursday) - Behind the Scenes
**Post Type:** Build in public
```
Week 1 stats on Sharp Recruit:

- X signups
- X JDs generated
- X CVs screened
- $X revenue

Lessons learned:
- Nobody cares about features, they care about outcomes
- "Free forever" converts better than "Free trial"
- Recruiters hate clunky software (who knew?)

Building in public is scary.
But hiding in the dark is scarier.

What should I build next?

#buildinpublic #saas #recruiting
```

### Day 5 (Friday) - Engagement Bait
**Post Type:** Question
```
Honest question for recruiters:

What's the ONE task that takes up most of your time?

A) Reviewing CVs
B) Writing job descriptions  
C) Scheduling interviews
D) Sourcing candidates
E) Something else (comment below)

I'm building AI tools to automate the boring stuff.

Your answers = what I build next.

#recruiting #poll
```

### Day 6 (Saturday) - Personal Story
**Post Type:** Narrative
```
2 years ago, I was a recruiter drowning in admin.

200+ CVs per role.
Hours writing JDs.
Endless interview scheduling.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I learned to code.

Today, I launched an AI tool that does in 10 minutes what used to take me all day.

It's not perfect.
But it works.

Sometimes the best solutions come from people who lived the problem.

What problem are you uniquely qualified to solve?

#recruiting #entrepreneurship #ai
```

### Day 7 (Sunday) - Rest / Engage
- No new post
- Reply to all comments from the week
- Engage on 10 recruiting/hiring posts
- DM 5 people who engaged with your content

### Day 8 (Monday) - Comparison
**Post Type:** Hot take
```
I compared Sharp Recruit to the "big" ATS platforms:

Workable: $149/month minimum
Loxo: Custom quote (translation: expensive)
Manatal: $15/user/month + setup

Sharp Recruit: Free forever plan

The big guys charge enterprise prices for features most recruiters never use.

I built something simpler.
Because simple actually gets used.

#recruiting #saas #startup
```

### Day 9 (Tuesday) - Social Proof
**Post Type:** Testimonial
```
"This saved me 30 minutes on my first JD."

That's what [Name] told me after trying Sharp Recruit.

30 minutes × 10 JDs per month = 5 hours saved

5 hours that could be spent:
- Talking to candidates
- Building client relationships
- Actually recruiting

The best tools don't add to your day.
They give time back.

```

### Day 10 (Wednesday) - Educational
**Post Type:** How-to
```
The 10-minute CV screening method:

1. Define your must-haves (3-5 max)
2. Create a scoring rubric
3. Batch process in groups of 10
4. Use AI for first pass
5. Human review the top 20%

Most recruiters spend 6 seconds per CV.
That's why they miss great candidates.

The fix isn't spending MORE time.
It's being more systematic.

AI handles volume.
Humans handle judgment.

#recruiting #hiring #productivity
```

### Day 11 (Thursday) - Feature Highlight
**Post Type:** Demo
```
New feature just shipped: Interview Question Generator

Tell it:
- The role
- Seniority level
- Focus areas

Get:
- Custom questions
- What good answers look like
- Red flags to watch for

No more Googling "interview questions for [role]"

Try it free: [link]

What feature should I build next?

#recruiting #interviews #ai
```

### Day 12 (Friday) - Weekend CTA
**Post Type:** Direct ask
```
If you're a recruiter, I have a favor to ask:

Try Sharp Recruit this weekend.
Screen some CVs.
Generate a JD.

Then tell me:
- What worked?
- What sucked?
- What's missing?

I'll personally reply to every piece of feedback.

Link in comments.

#recruiting #feedback #buildinpublic
```

### Day 13 (Saturday) - Thought Leadership
**Post Type:** Industry take
```
The future of recruiting isn't AI replacing recruiters.

It's AI handling:
- Initial screening
- Admin tasks
- Scheduling
- Data entry

So recruiters can focus on:
- Building relationships
- Selling opportunities
- Closing candidates
- Being human

The best recruiters will use AI.
The rest will be replaced by those who do.

#recruiting #ai #futureofwork
```

### Day 14 (Sunday) - Week Recap
**Post Type:** Reflection
```
2 weeks since launch. Here's what I've learned:

1. Ship fast, iterate faster
2. Talk to users daily
3. Simple beats feature-rich
4. Free tiers drive growth
5. LinkedIn > paid ads (for now)

Stats:
- X signups
- X CVs screened
